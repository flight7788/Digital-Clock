## Description

This DIY clock that has a 24-hour systema and we can use it as desktop clock.

It contain a PIC microcontroller, which will controll the 7-segment display and the 2 buttons are used to set Time、Date and Brightness.

It comes with auto power-off memory function. So, when there is power cut, it will run in background. Once the power is back, you don’t have to manually correct the time. It will automatically show the right time.
